## PR Description Template

```markdown
## Add Quotewise MCP Server

**What is Quotewise?**
Semantic quote search for AI assistants with 608K+ quotes. Unlike toy quote APIs with 60-100 quotes, Quotewise offers full semantic search using vector embeddings.

**Key features:**
- 🔍 Semantic search — find quotes by meaning, not keywords
- 📚 608K+ quotes from verified sources  
- 🔗 QuoteSightings — source transparency for every quote
- ✅ Attribution verification — catch misattributions
- 📁 Collections — save and organize quotes

**Why it belongs here:**
- Production-ready with OAuth authentication
- Hosted/cloud service (no local setup required)
- 13 MCP tools for comprehensive quote discovery
- Fills a gap — no serious quote MCP exists in the ecosystem

**Links:**
- Repo: https://github.com/quotewise/mcp
- MCP endpoint: https://mcp.quotewise.io/
- Docs: https://quotewise.io/developers/mcp/
```

## Where to Insert

In the `### 🧠 Knowledge & Memory` section, alphabetically. Currently the section includes entries like:
- Karakeep Semantic Search
- Inside-Out-2 Memory
- WhatsApp Memory Vault
- xuezh Chinese Learning

Quotewise would fit alphabetically after entries starting with "Q" or before entries starting with "R/S".
